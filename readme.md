# PIC18F7Q84 Two Axis CNC Machine

This project demonstrates an implementation of a 2-axis computer numerical
control (CNC) machine which makes use of the Direct Memory Address (DMA),
Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO) and other Core Independent Peripherals
(CIPs) to handle acceleration and movement with minimal input from the
microcontroller core.

- 2x Stepper Click board™ [(MIKROE-3402)](https://www.mikroe.com/stepper-click)
- 2 Axis CNC gantry - The code is designed to be flexible, such that it can
be modified to work with almost any XY stepper gantry selected, provided
the power requirements are not too great.
- 2x Limit switches - Switches should be located such that they are pressed when
the platform is at the (0, 0) position, and should be high when pressed.
- 2x stepper motors - The motors used will depend on the gantry, ensure
that they both move the end effector the same distance per tick, and must be
2-pole (4 wire) to work with the Stepper Click board™
- End Effector - Choice of end effector is likewise left flexible. As configured,
the end effector selected should be raised when the pin controlling it is low,
and lowered when the pin is high. This can be modified as needed to work with
a selected end effector.

## Setup

Most configuration is done through the config.h file. The configurations are:

- `TICKS_PER_METER`: the number of steps of the stepper motor required to move the
end effector one meter
- `X_MAX`/`YMAX`: the maximum range, in steps, of the X and Y axes
- `X_BACKWARDS`/`Y_BACKWARDS`: whether to reverse the direction of the stepper
motor on this axis
- `BUFFER_NUMBER_PACKETS`: the size of the command buffer. This can be left at the
default 5

Pinout is defined with two constants, `NAME_PIN_PORT` and `NAME_PIN_POS`. To
have pin Y_ENABLE on RA6, the code would be

```
#define Y_ENABLE_PIN_PORT RA
#define Y_ENABLE_PIN_POS 6
```

As configured, the Y axis Stepper Click board™ should go in slot 1, and the x
axis should be in slot 3.

By default the limit switch pin for the y axis is RA1, and the x axis is RC7.
The actuator is on pin RF2.

If an alternate method of controlling the actuator is desired, the relevant
functions to modify are `Platform_RaiseActuator()` and `Platform_LowerActuator()` in
platform.c which by default simply set ACTUATOR_PIN high/low.

<!-- Explain how to connect hardware and set up software. Depending on complexity, step-by-step instructions and/or tables and/or images can be used -->

## Operation

The CNC machine should be connected to the PC via USB. Operation of the PC
control GUI is explained in detail in the readme file in the pc-application
directory. An example G-Code that will draw a star is included in that
directory.

For the purposes of creating G-Code, the machine operates in the x and y axis,
with the location of the limit switches as (0, 0) and proceeding in the
positive direction. A value of Z0 will cause the end effector to lower, any
other value will cause it to raise.  Operation is limited to linear movement.
Movement in the Z axis and the X/Y plane simultaneously is not supported.

## Summary

<!-- Summarize what the example has shown -->

The example G-Code included with the PC application creates the star shown below.

This project demonstrates the ability of CIPs to complete tasks that would
traditionally require math and timing intensive tasks done by a more expensive
microcontroller.
